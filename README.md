A force sensitive resistor is connect to an ADC to the GPIO of a raspberry pi. when pressure is applied to the FSR, a signal is sent to the raspberry to turn the camera. the camera takes picture of the one in front of it. OpenCV will be installed on the camera for image recognition. a folder with images of the valid users of the car is saved on the pi. if the image of the person is same as any on the folder, a signal is sent to another GPIO of the pi to which a servo motor is connected to start it. Else, if the image of the person is not part of the images in the folder, the a zero signal is sent, which does not turn on the servo motor, but sends a signal a buzzer connected to it, and as well to a GSM module to send an SMS to a registered number, or an email to a registered email address.
